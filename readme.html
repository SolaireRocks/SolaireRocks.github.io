<font SIZE="2">Thanks for downloading this patch!<br>
<br>
In order to patch this file, please use the program below, make sure you use a Japanese version of Final Fantasy VI, and ALWAYS patch on a new ROM, NEVER over one you've already edited or patched prior; you'll have problems (ignore this if playing the English version as it's already ready to be played -Kain).<br><br>
　 ※(<A HREF="http://www.romhacking.net/utilities/240/">http://www.romhacking.net/utilities/240/</A>)<br>
<br>
Also, please patch this ROM to a non-header one.<br><br>
Using this patch changes the ROM from a HiROM to an ExHiROM, so please use an emulator that supports this.<br><br>
This patch is remodeled and based on HZ9Cy.3WvI's "Final Fantasy 6 Omega Additional Patch Version 18.2". I've also used a number of patches on top of this base mod. If there's any complaints from the creators, I'll delete the patch from the uploader. Please let me know though. Thank you.<br><br>

Please do not redistribute this patch. Regarding customizing this patch yourself, if you have the means, then go right ahead. Since this patch was originally remodeled after the "Omega" patch in the first place, I can't really say no.<br><br>
However, I'm against it if you decide to name your mod "Final Fantasy VI T-Edition" which is the name of this patch. This is because I don't want confusion or questions asked about said version since it's not really my work then. Please just make it your own and do not relate it to this (Note: Tsushiy was fine with an English version and more than happy people outside Japan would experience it, so we do have his basic permission and nothing more -Kain).<br><br>
Also, I'd appreciate it if you gave my patch credit somewhere if you end up doing something like this. Thank you.<br>
<br>
Please also note I'm not at liability for any damage this patch causes.<br>

Although this is a finished patch, there are times when bugs and other problems may be corrected and when updates may happen based on my mood.<br>
<br>
<DIV ALIGN="center"><A HREF="http://jbbs.livedoor.jp/game/55803/">Final Fantasy VI T-Edition Forums</A></DIV><br> 
(Japanese IP posting only. Tsushiy speaks very little English, so make sure if you post to post in Japanese -Kain)<br>
<br>
In addition, there has been new conversations, events, and changes made by me that are not in the original game. I've also added new music from other Final Fantasy games, as well as other Square titles. Depending on who plays, you may not enjoy it, and for this I'm sorry.<br>
<br>
Further more, this patch is not created with the intention of having as many people enjoy it as much as possible. I created it for me and decided to share it.<br>
<br>
Any additional events that are added, even if they were previously adjusted or added, I may change them with little to no notice.<br>
<br>
Any other patches can not be applied to this mod. There may be ways, however, it's very difficult. As for save data, <B><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">original game save data or other patches can not be used</FONT></B> (mainly due to how event flags are handled). Also, <B><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">save data from past versions of this patch will work, but problems may arise.</FONT></B><br>
<br>
The emulator used to check this patch's work is <b>UOSNES</b> Version <b>20100527</b>. Other emulators may not work. (SNES 9x and Higan work, as do some others, but not perfectly. Audio quality is sometimes off or sounds really bad for some of the songs he added. Please use the emulator included in the download if playing the Japanese version or if using SNES9x 1.60 simply go to Emulation >> Hacks >> OK >> Separate Echo Buffer from RAM -Kain)<br>

In addition to the "FF6 T-Edition X.X.X.ips" file which is the main part of FF6 T-Edition, "FF6 T-Edition EX X.X.X.ips" is also included with the download. You'll be able to play EX Mode after you clear the quest "Holy Angel Ultima" which is an additional event now in the original game. You'll need to save in a specific spot in the quest "Developer's Room", so make sure to read the <A HREF="newevent.html">newevent.html</A> for information.<br>
<br>
In "FF6 T-Edition EX X.X.X.ips", you can't play the normal game. Even if you try to make a new game, Terra will appear and explain things to you. Also, only data saved at a specific save point in the original game can be used (see the above). Please note you can't play this game normally because enemies, magic, and event flags in the data have been changed. This is not a normal game patch, just extra things not included in FF6 T-Edition.<br>

<font SIZE="3">Original Game Bug Fixes</font><br><br>
<font SIZE="2">

Note: The vast majority of bugs in FF6 have been fixed in general; only a few remain that unless you know this game in and out/are a speedrunner you will most likely never encounter them. Otherwise, the ones that remain won't affect gameplay and the list below are just ones Tsushiy made note of. In general, 99% of what you can think of has been fixed -Kain.<br><br>
<ul>
<li>Vanish Magic Bug<br>
 Originally if you used the spell Vanish then another magic spell on the target, it would ALWAYS work, especially with X-Zone. This has been corrected and resistances now work properly.</li>
<li>Evasion Bug<br>
 In the original game Evasion checked Magic Evasion. This has been fixed.</li>
<li>Blind Bug<br>
 Originally Blind had no effect what-so-ever. This has now been corrected.</li>
<li>Shadow Leaves the Party - Party Member Change Bug<br>
 In the original game if you took a party of Gau only to recruit Shadow when finding Terra and then went to the Veldt, used Leap with Gau and then returned to Narshe, Shadow would leave and crash the game with an empty party. This has been fixed because Gau no longer has Leap in this patch.</li>
<li>Damage Overflow Bug<br>
 In the original game making your statuses extremely high with Eidolon leveling and equipment would cause spell damage to overflow and do pitiful damage (Celes doing Blizzard for 30 damage as an example). This has been fixed because stats no longer change on level up now.</li>
<li>Airship Bug<br>
 Upon arriving on the Floating Continent the game still counts you as on the airship. If you leave, then immediately return and die, it puts you on the airsip and changes a value. This can cause bugs and allows for interesting things to happen. However, this has been changed because now you're returned to the Title Screen upon death.</li>
<li>Psycho Cyan Bug<br>
 In the original game when Cyan would use Sky, then die and be revived, the flag for it would never wear off, thus allowing for constant free counter attacks. This has been fixed.</li>
<li>Psycho Cyan Imp Bug<br>
 Like the above bug expect if Cyan is made into an Imp, he will now attack forever until the enemy is dead. This can't be fully fixed, however he will now only counter attack once.</li>
</ul>
<font SIZE="3">FF6 T-Edition Bugs</font>
<font SIZE="2">

<div>
<ul>
<li>In Locke's scenario the game will sometimes crash when using "Steal" on a merchant or soldier.<br>
　<B>※It hasn't been confirmed in the current version, but there are reports of it. Try saving and reloading to counter this. (Try altering the game's RNG with Steal, such as change the frame when you select Steal on with save states if this occurs. This is an extremely rare bug and you may see it not even once a playthrough -Kain.)</B></li>
<li>When an event has ended you may be unable to talk to NPCs.<br>
　<B>※This is easily fixed by entering and exiting a menu or changing areas to another map. (Has not occured in English at all -Kain.)</B></li>
<li>In the Item Menu during battle some of the displays on items look odd. (Quotation marks, etc. Minor thing -Kain.)</li>
<li>Items added via the Omega patch are not sorted properly with auto-sort or don't appear correctly when stolen. <b><font COLOR="red">(NO LONGER APPLIES TO THE ENGLISH VERSION AS OF 9/18/20 -Kain.)</font></b></li>
　※This is due to the item sharing the ID with the original item used and its placement.</li>
<li>Numbers on the Item Menu of items after the 256th item are not displayed correctly. <b><font COLOR="red">(NO LONGER APPLIES TO THE ENGLISH VERSION AS OF 9/18/20 -Kain.)</font></b></li>
<li>Some graphics of enemies in the Coliseum don't display properly.</li>
<li>Some graphics of sprites during Auction House bids may not display properly.</li>
<li>In the Coliseum, betting an item with an additional ID becomes a different one that will be lost instead. <b><font COLOR="red">(NO LONGER APPLIES TO THE ENGLISH VERSION AS OF 9/18/20 -Kain.)</font></b></li>
Example: Betting a "Hero's Ring" with ID100 becomes a "Dagger" with ID000 which is lost.</li>
<li>If you bet an item above the 255th item slot in your inventory, you are actually betting a different item. <b><font COLOR="red">(English lua script will notify you if you try to bet an item above the 255 slot in your inventory -Kain.)</font></b><br>
　※Place it below the 256th item slot and you'll be fine.</li>
<li>If you steal any items during a Coliseum battle you won't lose your bet.</li>
<li>Some enemies have odd positioning in the Coliseum battles.</li>
<li>The Vanish status will not be broken if hit by the spell "Break" when that character has Petrification immunity.<br>
　※Since this is a minor thing at present, I'll consider it a nice feature.</li>
<li>The color of the spell "Reflect" when a spell is bounced is strange.<br>
　※This is due to changing the color of recovery and MP damage.</li>
<li>When using Gogo's "Chameleon Robe" costume in the Coliseum your appearance won't change.<br>
　※This was done so a bug doesn't happen and I've no plans to change it.</li>
<li>During battle against certain enemies who use Celes's Runic ability, if you also use Runic and absorb a spell, it will show the graphic for them using Runic as well.</li>
<li>All items are not displayed during battle or when selling. <b><font COLOR="red">(NO LONGER APPLIES TO THE ENGLISH VERSION AS OF 9/18/20 -Kain.)</font></b></li>
　※This can be fixed by auto-sorting, especially if they're medicines.</li>
<li>There's certain maps that makes characters wearing costumes show up with odd colors. This isn't fixable and won't affect your gameplay.<br>
　※This happens in Zozo, Phoenix Cave's entrance, Ancient Castle, and during Terra's Trance event for example.</li>
<li>While playing New Game+, actual party members instead of Moogles may appear when hitting the Y Button during the "Save Terra!" event with the Moogles/Locke.</li>

Q. Where's the Eidolon that teaches ○? or ○? How do you learn the magic ●? or ●? (Note: These are blank on purpose for examples.)<br>
A. Many things have been deleted, changed, or added. Please see the html files for more information.<br>
<br>
Q. I can't beat this boss...<br>
A. Final Fantasy 6 is a game with a large level correction. Gain some levels and try again.<br>
<br>
Q. The enemy attacks so fast and I act so slow.<br>
A. More powerful actions such as "Blitz", "Tools", and "X-Magic" take longer to cast due to their power. Try using "Haste", "Slow", etc. "Fight" and using Eidolons are also very quick actions.<br>
<br>
Q. Random encounters are way too difficult.<br>
A. You'll run into problems if you have the mentality from the original game of just using Fight only.<br><br>
Enemies with complete status immunity are rare, including bosses. I can't stress this enough. Try using Confuse, Blind, Sleep, Silence, Toad, etc, even if you think "there's no way that'll work!", you may be surprised...<br><br>
Also, unlike the original game, instant death, petrification resistance, and near-death tolerance are now separated. Break, Gravity, and Tornado may work on enemies they previously didn't. Death is also an option now.<br>
<br>
Q. I can't fight Valigarmanda in the World of Ruin.<br>
A. Terra must be in your party now. Try again.<br>
<br>
Q. I can't beat the new battle against Kefka on the Floating Continent.<br>
A. Even if you lose, the game will proceed like normal. However, if you win, you'll get a nice item. He has a very nice item to steal, too!<br>
<br>
Q. The random encounters underneath Figaro Castle in the World of Ruin are too difficult, and there's no way to recover...<br>
A. The collapsed soldier at the start of the dungeon will now freely heal you.<br>
<br>
Q. Yellow and Skull Dragon are no longer in Kefka's Tower?<br>
A. I've moved them to new places. Try exploring areas you've visited previously.<br>
<br>
Q. I can't open the king's room at Doma Castle once inside Cyan's Dream. Why?<br>
A. Walk around and view all of his past memories, then you'll be able to.<br>
<br>
Q. How do you win the last 3 solo battles of Cyan's Dream?<br>
A. Even if you lose, the game will proceed like normal, but you'll get a nice accessory for winning.<br>
<br>
Q. How can I defeat the Holy Dragon in Fanatic's Tower?<br>
A. Defeat "Omniscient" (すべてをしるもの) at the very top, then the battle against Holy Dragon will be normalized. (Fight, etc will become available.)<br>
<br>
Q. I keep hearing odd noises during some of the BGM...<br>
A. It's the emulator. I use UOSNES Version 20100527, as that what was checked and used for the patch, so I highly recommend you use it as well for the best performance. (We've attempted and had most of the glaring song issues fixed thanks to emberling in the English version, but some are still off slightly. Please listen to the music on UOSNES if you want the best version. The reason for the sound quality is due to UOSNES bypassing the SNES audio RAM limitation, where ZSNES, 9X, etc, all have limits. The sound quality is superior and is not possible to truly fix for any other emulator beyond fixing the beeps and boops or grating glitchy noises.)<br>

This patch has become very unique and has surpassed my personal desire for FF6. My modding policy is basically - "enhance any enemy that's weak", "balance any breakable items with magic properties", "make it look as if its been remodeled" and "add events during the World of Ruin". As it currently stands, I'm very happy.<br>
<br>
What I mean to say is, after all this work is done, I want to play the patch! Because it's my concept, I feel like many things may not fit perfectly. Fortunately, since the analysis of Final Fantasy 6 modding has been made much easier thanks to many talented people, I think that it's good to try and do your own modding!<br><br>
In addition, this patch uses various additional songs in each map, regular battles, and event battles. I think some people won't like it, but I'd appreciate it if you understand I did this for myself. Sorry.<br>
<br>
As for the additional events, since it is not possible to have a collective production time, it seems that there will be a lot of bugs and glitches in the event flags mainly. It will be very difficult if I constantly release patches from now on, but I would appreciate it if you could point out any mistakes or errors.<br>
<br>
Finally, I'm thankful to ◆HZ9Cy.3WvI, the author for "Final Fantasy 6 Omega Additional Patch", which is what this is based off of, and the authors of various tools for the work that I've referred to. Thanks once more to the authors and those who wrote on the forum of FF6 T-Edition. Thanks to everyone who had any knowledge of modding at all and assisted. I would like to take this opportunity to thank you again.<br>
